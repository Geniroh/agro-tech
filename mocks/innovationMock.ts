      "This is an electrical Yam Pounding machine that reduces the amount of physical energy and time involved in pounding the widely enjoyed African delicacy - pounded yam. \n\nIt was fabricated by researchers from the Department of Agricultural Engineering at Obafemi Awolowo University and is now commercially available and widely used. This equipment was a unique innovation in its time which facilitated easier and faster yam processing. A Japanese firm stole the knowledge and flooded Nigeria with their own version that cooks and pounds. Today, there are several locally produced and imported versions of the yam pounder in the market",
